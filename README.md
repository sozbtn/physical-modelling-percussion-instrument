# physical-modelling-percussion-instrument

This repository contains the code to run a multidimensional digital percussion instrument based on physical modelling synthesis, utilising the Sensel Morph as its main hardware component. Details of the implementation can be found in a [publication](https://zenodo.org/record/1422605#.W-Gc4npKh25) to the Sound and Music Computing Conference 2018, with a short [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZT4uirgQBM).
